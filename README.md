# canvas minesweeper

yet another clone of minesweeper! i was bored, and wanted to program something
fun!

i tried out some interesting technical decisions/limitations with this
implementation:

- no libraries
- render everything to <canvas>
- no assets (draw things like mines and flags procedurally)
